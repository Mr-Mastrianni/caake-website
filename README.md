## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge)
- Basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript if you want to make modifications

### Setup

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine
2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser to view the website locally
3. For deployment, upload all files to your web hosting service

## Customization

### Images

The website uses placeholder images in the `/assets/images/` directory. Replace these with your own images to personalize the website. Recommended image sizes:

- Hero background: 1920x1080px
- Service icons: 128x128px
- Team photos: 500x500px
- Blog thumbnails: 800x600px

### Content

Update the content in HTML files to match your specific services, team members, and company information. Key areas to customize:

- Company description and tagline on the homepage
- Service descriptions and benefits
- Team member information and photos
- Contact information
- Blog articles and categories

### Styling

The website uses a color scheme defined in the CSS variables at the top of the `styles.css` file. To change the color scheme, modify these variables:

```css
:root {
    --primary-color: #007bff;    /* Primary blue color */
    --secondary-color: #ffffff;  /* Secondary white color */
    --accent-color: #ffc107;     /* Accent yellow color */
    --text-color: #333333;       /* Text color */
    --light-gray: #f8f9fa;       /* Light gray for backgrounds */
    /* Other variables... */
}
```

## Browser Compatibility

The website is compatible with:
- Chrome (latest)
- Firefox (latest)
- Safari (latest)
- Edge (latest)

## Additional Notes

- The contact form requires backend implementation to actually send emails or store submissions. You'll need to add form handling logic on your server.
- For the blog functionality to be fully dynamic, you may want to implement a content management system (CMS) or blog platform.
- Consider adding analytics to track visitor behavior and improve your website over time.
