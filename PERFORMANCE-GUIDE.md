# CAAKE Website Performance Guide

This document outlines the performance optimizations implemented for the CAAKE website to improve Core Web Vitals metrics and mobile responsiveness.

## Core Web Vitals Metrics

The optimizations focus on improving the following Core Web Vitals metrics:

1. **Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)** - Measures loading performance.
   - Goal: Under 2.5 seconds

2. **First Input Delay (FID)** - Measures interactivity.
   - Goal: Under 100 milliseconds

3. **Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)** - Measures visual stability.
   - Goal: Under 0.1

## Implemented Optimizations

### Resource Loading Optimizations

- **Preconnect to Critical Origins**: The site now uses `preconnect` to establish early connections to external domains (fonts, CDNs).
- **Critical Resource Preloading**: CSS files and important fonts are now preloaded.
- **JavaScript Optimization**: Non-critical scripts are now deferred or loaded asynchronously.
- **Font Loading Strategy**: Font display behavior is optimized to reduce layout shifts.

### Image Optimizations

- **Lazy Loading**: Images now load only when they enter the viewport area.
- **Placeholder Images**: Lightweight placeholders are shown until the actual image loads.
- **Explicit Dimensions**: All images now have width and height attributes to prevent layout shifts.
- **Responsive Images**: Images are now properly sized for different viewport widths.

### CSS Optimizations

- **CLS Prevention**: Added properties to prevent layout shifts, especially with dynamic content.
- **Container Stabilization**: Key UI elements now use CSS `contain` property for better rendering performance.
- **Mobile-Optimized Layout**: Improved mobile-specific styles with better tap targets and readable typography.
- **Reduced Motion**: Added support for users who prefer reduced motion for accessibility.

### JavaScript Performance Improvements

- **Device-Based Optimizations**: Automatically detects low-end devices and reduces animations.
- **Intersection Observer**: Only runs animations when elements are in the viewport.
- **Debouncing & Throttling**: High-frequency events (scroll, resize) are now optimized.
- **Animation Frame Handling**: Uses `requestAnimationFrame` for smoother animations.
- **Deferred Calculations**: Non-critical calculations are now executed after the page load.

### Mobile Responsiveness Improvements

- **Improved Tap Targets**: Interactive elements (buttons, links) now have a minimum size of 44x44px.
- **Typography Optimization**: Improved font sizes and line heights for better readability on mobile.
- **Input Field Optimization**: Form elements are now mobile-friendly (16px font size, proper height).
- **Grid/Flexbox Adjustments**: Layout grids now properly stack on smaller screens.
- **Orientation Support**: Added responsive styles for both portrait and landscape orientations.
- **iOS-Specific Fixes**: Fixed 100vh issue and improved scrolling behavior on iOS devices.

## Performance Monitoring

The website now includes built-in performance monitoring:

- **Core Web Vitals Monitoring**: Uses Performance Observer to track LCP, FID, and CLS in real-time.
- **Self-Optimizing Behavior**: Website automatically applies further optimizations if metrics are poor.
- **Mobile Audit Tool**: Added a `mobile-audit.js` script that can diagnose mobile-specific issues.

## Mobile Audit Tool Usage

1. Open the website in a browser
2. Open the developer console (F12 or Right-click > Inspect)
3. Copy the entire content of `mobile-audit.js` into the console
4. Run the command: `MobileAudit.runAudit()`
5. Review the detailed report with passes, warnings, and failures

## Maintenance Guidelines

When updating the website, please follow these guidelines to maintain performance:

### Adding New Images

```html
<!-- Use this pattern for new images -->
<img 
  src="assets/images/placeholder.jpg" 
  data-src="assets/images/actual-image.jpg" 
  alt="Descriptive text" 
  class="lazy-load" 
  width="800" 
  height="600"
>
```

### Adding New JavaScript

- Defer non-critical scripts with `defer` or `async` attributes
- Use event delegation instead of many individual event listeners
- Utilize the existing `debounce` and `throttle` functions for high-frequency events

### Adding New CSS

- Place mobile-first styles in the main rule blocks
- Use media queries with `min-width` for larger screen adjustments
- Avoid large fixed-width elements that could cause overflow on mobile

### Adding New Animations

- Utilize the existing animation system by adding the `animate-on-scroll` class
- Add `data-animation="type"` attribute with the animation type
- For heavy animations, add fallbacks for low-end devices

## Performance Testing
